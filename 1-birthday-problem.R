# part 1 ####

# suppose there are 30 students in a class. estimate the probability that at least one pair
# of students has the same birthday.you can ignore the possibility of people being born
# on Feb 29 during a leap-year.




# part 2 ####

# estimate the probability for class sizes from 5-60, and plot the resulting curve 
# (x axis is class size, y axis is probability of at least one shared birthday)

# hint! turn your code from part 1 into a function that has one parameter: class size.
# the function should run many simulations, and return the probability of a match across
# the set of simulations. then, in this part, call the function for classes from size 5-60.
# you could even do this in steps of 5 rather than estimating it for all sizes.
